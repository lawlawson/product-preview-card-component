## My process

### Built with

### What I learned

I have been working on improving my semantic HTML knowledge and also to make my code more accessible. Also, writing CSS using BEM methodolgy as I have been reading on it's benefits recently, such as being a declarative syntax that can help designers and developers communicate more effectively. Overall, I wanted to work on improving my skills in creating components to near pixel perfect solutions.
